# 👋 Hi, I’m Navas Herbert

I’m an **AI-augmented Data & AI Engineer** and **SaaS builder** with a strong background in data engineering, analytics, and full-stack development. I work at the intersection of **data, automation, and product**, leveraging AI assistants and agent-based workflows to build systems faster, smarter, and at scale.

I enjoy solving real-world problems by designing **robust data pipelines**, **intelligent backend systems**, and **production-ready SaaS platforms** — from idea to launch.

---

## 🧠 What I do best

- **AI-assisted engineering**  
  I collaborate with AI assistants for coding, debugging, architectural reasoning, and rapid prototyping — using AI as a force multiplier, not a shortcut.

- **Data & backend systems**  
  Designing scalable batch and streaming pipelines, data models, and APIs that power real products and decision-making.

- **Automation & agents**  
  Building automated workflows and agent-based systems (n8n, serverless functions) to reduce manual work and increase reliability.

- **Startup & product engineering**  
  Turning ideas into shipped products with real users, payments, and infrastructure.

## 🚀 Current focus

- **Founder / AI Engineer @ SquadDrive (SaaS)**  
  A community-driven platform for car owners and events, currently preparing for launch.  
  I’m actively working on:
  - Secure subscription payments (Paystack)
  - Real-time features
  - Scalable backend architecture
  - Product iteration using AI-assisted workflows

- Exploring **AI engineering roles** and **startup-focused opportunities** where building and ownership matter.
